# doc_modelt
 Based on the 1911 Ford Model T with some minor changes made to the model to be suitable for RedM. The logo has been changed from Ford to Fjord to avoid any copyright issues with real world brandings. 

 This is being provided free of charge to the RedM community to further research on vehicle metas and replacements so we can eventually move to having our own vehicles in-game. I ask that if you make anything with this model that you also provide it free of charge to the community. RedM is small and only by working together can we all advance it further, keeping everything seperate and insult just harms the community!

 This is a simple prop, it is not a working vehicle nor will it ever be. If you have questions about it, please reach out via the platform it was posted (VORP-Core Discord) and do not DM me.

 Original model was made by Marowgo
